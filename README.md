## Ulyssses_snapshot

Developed by RoyRogers56.

This Python script takes a snapshot of all Ulysses III Sheets, to a readable folder structure, named with Group and Sheet titles.
Groups and Sheets are prefixed with sequence numbers.
Original sheet's modified dates are also preserved.

Individual Sheets or Groups can be restored by dragging them to Ulysses via Finder. 
Filters, glued sheets, and original modified time, will not be preserved when restoring from Archive.

If complete library restoration is needed, rely on the complete library backup (below) instead.
Filters, glued sheets, and original modified time, will then also be restored.
DO NOT drag in the backup file! But replace the UL Library Document folder with the backup.

Optional: convert all Ulysses Sheets to Markdown files,
with all special MarkdownXL tags and attachmets included in HTML tags and comment blocks.
Original sheet's modified dates are also preserved.
Embedded images are included in "/Media/" folder
